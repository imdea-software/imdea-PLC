# Monads for ~~Functional Programmers~~ IMDEA people
=========================================================================

[TO DO: scope and objectives]

What we will not see, at least in this first session:

1. Monads in/and Category Theory.
1. Computational Lambda Calculus.
2. How to combine monads.
3. Newer approaches to combining effects: free(r) monads, algebraic effects, extensible effects.
4. Indexed Monads and Verification: HTT, R* and other Klieski Arrows of Outrageous fortune.

## Plan

1. Monads for Functional Programmig.
2. Monads for Logic Programming.
3. A poor man's concurrency monad.
4. Monad's for security? / Monadic Parsers?.

## 1: Monads for Functional Programming

**Paper:** Phil Wadler. _Monads for Functional Programming_. Available [here](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/marktoberdorf/baastad.pdf).

**Host:** [@germanD](https://github.com/germanD)

**Date**: Dec 16th, 2016.. 16.30hs. Meeting Room 315.

### Resources & Further Reading###

There are lots of monads tutorials, guides and blog-posts around. Most of them are **not** really that useful. I find these, however, worth mentioning:

1. [Monads: Programmer's Definition](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2016/11/21/monads-programmers-definition/) from [Bartoz Milewskis' Programming Caff√©](https://bartoszmilewski.com/) has an __imperative-programmer-friendly__ introduction. The [next post in the series](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2016/11/30/monads-and-effects/) is a bit more advanced and, _caveat emptor_, requires speaking some Category Theory lingo. They are both intended as a part for a **CT for programmers** series.
 
2. From the same author, there is also an older series of posts called "Monads for the Curious Programmer": [Part I](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2011/01/09/monads-for-the-curious-programmer-part-1/) and [Part II](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2011/01/09/monads-for-the-curious-programmer-part-2/).

As the paper points out, the credit for discovering how to use monads for giving semantics to impure effectuful computations should go to E. Moggi. His IC91 paper (below) was the inspiration for the whole *monadic* revolution. If you are interesting in dwelving seriously into the subject, it is a good place to start. There might, of course, be dragons.
