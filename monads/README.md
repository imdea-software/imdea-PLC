###Plan

**[TO DO]**

### Resources & Further Reading###

There are lots of monads tutorials, guides and blog-posts around. Most of them are **not** really that useful. I find these, however, worth mentioning:

1. [Monads: Programmer's Definition](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2016/11/21/monads-programmers-definition/) from [Bartoz Milewskis' Programming Caff√©](https://bartoszmilewski.com/) has an __imperative-programmer-friendly__ introduction. The [next post in the series](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2016/11/30/monads-and-effects/) is a bit more advanced and, _caveat emptor_, requires speaking some Category Theory lingo. They are both intended as a part for a **CT for programmers** series.
 
2. From the same author, there is also an older series of posts called "Monads for the Curious Programmer": [Part I](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2011/01/09/monads-for-the-curious-programmer-part-1/) and [Part II](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2011/01/09/monads-for-the-curious-programmer-part-2/).
