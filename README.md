# IMDEA Software Programming Languages Club
==============================================================================

## About.

The IMDEA Software Programming Languages Club is and almost informal Programming Languages reading club, meeting approximately twice per month, provided someone brings cake[1].

[1] Though cookies, the _physical_ ones, might do.

## Scope.

Given the broadth of both interest and experience of those who attended the first meeting, our plan is to mix introductory topics together with _classic_ papers and/or _pearls_, and eventually, cutting edege research from the latest PL conferences.

## Structure.

This group will meet by-weekly. In order to cater for a bigger audience, the club is structure in sessions: a series of meetings with some common theme to it. The meetings will generally consist in the presentation and discussion of one paper or topic.

### Sessions.

The PLC is structured around sessions, i.e. a consecutive number of meetings with a common sub-topic in mind. For e.g. the first sessions will be ```Monads for Functional Programmers```, and will consist of 3 or 4 meetings.

### Meetings.

In each meeting there will be at least one host, in charge of presenting the paper/topic and chairing the discussion. This presentations needen't be formal, and slides are not expected. The role of the host(s) is to encourage the discussion of those who have attended. Live demos or colletive coding experiences or exercices are welcome.
